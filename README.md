# Wikipedia â€“ Ego Hyperlink Network Analysis of Selected Articles

Python scripts used to collect and analyse Wikipedia data for my MSc thesis at the Oxford Internet Institute. 

This thesis investigated how differences in both the content and structure of "crowdsourced history" between language editions on Wikipedia are developed and organised by hyperlinks and in turn the hyperlink structure that connects articles and governs possibilities of navigation between articles. The thesis investigated this phenomenon via a case study of the hyperlink ego network of the "World War 2" articles in the English and German editions of Wikipedia.
